# Cairo ImGui - Missing Features & Future Roadmap

**Last Updated**: October 27, 2025

This document catalogs features that are **not yet implemented**, **intentionally excluded**, or **postponed** in the Cairo ImGui immediate-mode GUI toolkit.

---

## Philosophy: Intentional Simplicity

Many "missing" features are **by design**. The project goals are:
1. **Keep it simple** - Easy to understand, minimal code
2. **Immediate mode focus** - No retained state, direct rendering
3. **Static layout** - No complex layout engines
4. **Proof of concept** - Demonstrate SDL3 + Cairo integration

Therefore, some features are **intentionally excluded** to maintain simplicity.

## Categories

- ðŸ”´ **Not Planned** - By design, excluded to maintain simplicity
- ðŸŸ¡ **Postponed** - Feasible but deferred, may implement later
- ðŸŸ¢ **Planned** - Actively considering, likely to implement
- âšª **Under Consideration** - Evaluating feasibility/value

## Contributing

If you'd like to implement a **ðŸŸ¢ Planned** or **âšª Considering** feature:

1. **Check current status** - Feature may be in progress
2. **Open an issue first** - Discuss approach before coding
3. **Keep it simple** - Follow project philosophy
4. **Test thoroughly** - Include automated tests
5. **Document well** - Update this file and FEATURES.md

**Guidelines**:
- Maintain immediate-mode design
- No external dependencies beyond SDL3/Cairo
- Keep API minimal and consistent
- Preserve simplicity (avoid feature creep)

---

## Why Not Implemented?

### Design Constraints

**"Why no layout engine?"**
- Immediate mode benefits from explicit positioning
- Auto-layout adds significant complexity
- Static layouts are predictable and debuggable

**"Why no retained mode option?"**
- Project goal is immediate-mode proof-of-concept
- Retained mode is a completely different architecture
- Use other toolkits (Qt, GTK) for retained mode

**"Why no keyboard focus?"**
- Adds state management complexity
- Hover-based interaction is simpler
- Deferred to Phase 3 (not a blocker for basic use)

**"Why no rich text?"**
- Complex text layout requires dedicated library
- Cairo text API is basic by design
- Use Pango or similar if needed (external dependency)

---

## Alternatives for Missing Features

If you need features marked **ðŸ”´ Not Planned**:

- **Layout engine** â†’ Use [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui), [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear)
- **Complex widgets** â†’ Use [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/)
- **Retained mode** â†’ Use traditional GUI toolkits
- **Web/mobile** â†’ Use web frameworks or native toolkits
- **Rich text** â†’ Integrate [Pango](https://pango.gnome.org/)

**This toolkit is for**:
- Simple tools and utilities
- Learning immediate-mode GUI concepts
- Prototyping with SDL3 + Cairo
- Lightweight desktop apps

**This toolkit is NOT for**:
- Complex production applications
- Mobile/web apps
- Rich document editing
- AAA game UI (use specialized game UI libs)

---

## Version History

- **2025-10-27**: Initial missing features documentation
- Future updates will track implemented features moving from this file to FEATURES.md

---

**Philosophy**: A small, simple, well-documented toolkit is better than a large, complex, poorly-understood one. Not every feature needs to exist in every library.
